# website-watchdog

I am interested in developing a website monitoring service. This service will allow users to track changes on various websites. Here are the key features I envision:

Website List: Users can add or remove websites from their list. Each website on the list is associated with its HTML content.
Frequency Setting: Users can set a specific frequency at which the service checks for changes on each website in their list.
Change Sensitivity: Users can define a threshold for the number of character changes in the HTML content of a website that constitutes a significant change.
Email Notifications: If a websiteâ€™s HTML content changes significantly (i.e., it deviates by more than the set threshold of characters), the service will send an email notification to the userâ€™s registered email address.
the inputs the user can and has to input: the actual websites to track, for each website a threshold and a frequency (requests per hour, than ca be a max of 4) and his personal email to where the emails are to be sent with the notification. The notification email will contain the message changes detected + the url where the changes were detected. 
Make sure that all functionalities are implemented in their entirety and the code is complete.
